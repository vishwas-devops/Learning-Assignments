### Workshop
> Hi Ninja's, you have to provide a complete solution for an application 

> make a scalable infrastructure on aws with tags like env: dev, project: shoa
  - Create cloudwatch alarms for scaling up and scaling down along with sns topic to notify you during any scaling operation
  - scale up if av. cpu threashold > 70
  - scale down if av. cpu threashold < 40

> stack would run our spring3 hibernate application

> integrate ansible with jenkins as deployments will be done using dynamic inventory in ansible

> publish test reports on jenkins and static code analysis on sonar

> decide what deployment strategy you will be using
  - all at once
  - rolling
  - rolling in batches

> What you need:
