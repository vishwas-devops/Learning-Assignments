    - Then try to run the complete playbook but it should execute the task for `tom` user creation.
- Create a task to install **cron** package only if I pass a variable `install=yep`.
- Create a task in which it will create a file in /tmp on below condition.
    - Let's assume **region** is a variable. So if the region value is east the file should contain central and if the region value is central then it should contain eastern.
- Create a playbook which will include user creation playbook.
