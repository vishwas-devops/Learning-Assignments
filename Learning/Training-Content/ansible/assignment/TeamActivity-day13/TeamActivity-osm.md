# Team Activity 


#### Opstree OSM Roles needs to be Refactor on the basis of below mentioned Role acceptance criteria.
1. Prechecks required for any package installation
1. If shell command is to be used then there should be some guard pattern for idem-potency
1. Maximum use of ansible module
1. Role should not be os dependent
1. Readme must be there along with brief snippet of code that shows 
-- how role will be executed 
-- version of the tool/software going to be installed using the role
-- compatible os versions. 
1. use of vault encrypted passwords rather than plan text
1. Teams will commit the updated roles in their own git hub repos with the modification documented in Readme.md . 

1. Roles are available at  [osm-repo](https://github.com/opstree-ansible)
