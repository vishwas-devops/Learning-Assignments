## Assignments
## Must Do
- create a user test1 using useradd  
- create a user test2 using adduser  
- compare their entries in /etc/passwd file and /etc/shadow file  
- add a new group named testGroup  
- add test1 and test2 to that group using usermod  
- make test1 to be able to login to system and work like normal user  
- remove user test1 and test2  
- remove group testGroup  

## Good To Do
- you will be given a csv file containing name, group, shell, home dir for n user. Create a shell script to add those user with provided configuration.  
- also give them a uniq default password so that they can login to their with that password and change it later
